# Java-Casino
This is more of a review for me on Java. We are just going to make a simple little casino.

# Java Casino, Games
The Games will be listed as such
1. Blackjack
3. Roulette
4. Slots
5. War
6. Poker

# What will the code include
Each game will include some instructions on how to play the game.
It will also have an exit button (or you can mainly type exit) if you want to leave a game mid-match or just want to leave the <em>"Casion"</em>

# Why make this?
Simple. I need a review on Java and see how bad i code.
In reality, one of my classes requires me to fully understand java, but its been a minute since I actually fully coded in java. so i want to play this out to see if i can code in jave again.
